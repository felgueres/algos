ELEMENTARY GRAPH ALGORITHMS

BFS. Path finding in trees or graphs
- Uses FIFO queue, eg. adds from the right, takes from the left, [1,2,3,4]  1 got in first and will be popped out first too
- Explore reachability and path length in trees and graphs 
- Shortest paths for unweighted graphs
- Minimum Spanning Trees for unweighted graphs
- Serial/Deserial of binary tree

Relaxation
- For each vertex v in V, maintain an attribute v.d, which is an upper bound on the weight of a shortest path
- Tests whether we can improve shortest path to v found so far by going through u, if so, updating v.d and v.pi
- Shortest paths differ in how many times you relax per edge, Djisktra exactly once, Bellman-Ford (V-1)  

DFS. Path finding in trees and graphs
- Edge types has info about relationship between edges 
- Backtracking properties. Reversible to previous state, ensures exploration of all paths 
- Keeping track of times. Serves to find timeline of exploration, useful for detecting cycles and understanding graph

Edges:
- tree edges. edge (u,v) if v first discovered by exploring (u,v)
- back edges. edge (u,v) connecting vertex u to ancestor v. self-loops in directed graphs are also back edges
- forward edges. edge (u,v) connecting vertex u to descendant v in tree. nontree edge
- cross edges. all other edges connecting vertices as long as one is not descendant on another

TopoSort. Order DAG such that for every vertex U to V, U comes before V in the ordering. 
- Good for longest or shortest path finding in linear time

Strongly Connected Components. Maximal set of vertices such that there is a path from U to V and a path from V to U (one way are not strongly connected)
- By decomposing into SCC you can analyze dependencies in networks like software modules, social graphs and websites

Minimum spanning trees (MST). Connects all weighted vertices with minimum total weight.
- Wire an electronic circuit with least amount of wire

Algos: MST-Generic, Kruskal, Prim, MST-Reduce
