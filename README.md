## GRAPH ALGORITHMS

BFS. Path finding in trees or graphs
- Uses FIFO queue, eg. adds from the right, takes from the left, [1,2,3,4]  1 got in first and will be popped out first too
- Explore reachability and path length in trees and graphs 
- Shortest paths for unweighted graphs
- Minimum Spanning Trees for unweighted graphs
- Serial/Deserial of binary tree
- The ops of dequeing and queuing is constant - O(1) -, so total time devoted to queing and dequeing is O(V), scanning the adjency lists take O(E), therefore this algo takes O(V+E) 

Relaxation
- For each vertex v in V, maintain an attribute v.d, which is an upper bound on the weight of a shortest path
- Tests whether we can improve shortest path to v found so far by going through u, if so, updating v.d and v.pi
- Shortest paths differ in how many times you relax per edge, Djisktra exactly once, Bellman-Ford (V-1) 
- Note that bellman-ford is designed for digraphs, using on undigraphs is super complex 

DFS. Path finding in trees and graphs
- Edge types has info about relationship between edges 
- Backtracking properties. Reversible to previous state, ensures exploration of all paths 
- Keeping track of times. Serves to find timeline of exploration, useful for detecting cycles and understanding graph
- Complexity in its base case is O(V+E) on an adj list and O(V^2) on a matrix
- Initalizing the algo takes V, visiting the nodes takes E 

Edges:
- tree edges. edge (u,v) if v first discovered by exploring (u,v)
- back edges. edge (u,v) connecting vertex u to ancestor v. self-loops in directed graphs are also back edges
- forward edges. edge (u,v) connecting vertex u to descendant v in tree. nontree edge
- cross edges. all other edges connecting vertices as long as one is not descendant on another

TopoSort. Order DAG such that for every vertex U to V, U comes before V in the ordering. 
- Good for longest or shortest path finding in linear time

Strongly Connected Components. Maximal set of vertices such that there is a path from U to V and a path from V to U (one way are not strongly connected)
- By decomposing into SCC you can analyze dependencies in networks like software modules, social graphs and websites

Minimum spanning trees (MST). Connects all weighted vertices with minimum total weight.
- Wire an electronic circuit with least amount of wire
- Algorithms: MST-Generic, Kruskal, Prim, MST-Reduce

#### Heuristics

| Scenario | Algorithm | Reason | Complexity |
| -------- | --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Find shortest path in unweighted graph | BFS | Guarantess shortest path due to exploring level by level | V+E or V^2, adj vs matrix, V is when looping to initialize, E is when exploring edges 
| Unweighted directed graph | BFS | Ideal for unweighted (directed and indirected) as guarentees shortest path by exploring vertices in order of their distance to source | V + E for adjencent list |
| Find all paths | DFS | Easy to explore all paths. Useful when you don't necessarily need the shortest. | V+E or V^2, adj vs matrix, V is when looping to initialize, E is when exploring edges
| Find all paths | BFS | This requires a variation, relaxing the constraint of a global visit set. Lets you search all paths and add other constraints | V+E or V^2, adj vs matrix, V is when looping to initialize, E is when exploring edges
| Find shortest path in weighted graph with negative weights | Bellman-Ford | Relaxation helps find min cost paths and handles negative cycles | On acyclic, you can do V + E by using toposort, otherwise V^2
| Topo sort | DFS | Useful to improve performance on other alorithms like Bellman-Ford | V + E
| Minimum depth | BFS | Fits with level-by-level exploration | V + E
| Cycle detection in digraph
| Connected components
