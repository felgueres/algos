# Algorithms

*Path finding* Explore graphs and trees
Apps
- Explore properites of tree or node, eg. paths, reachability 

Algos
- BFS, DFS
- TopoSort. Order DAG such that for every vertex u to v, u comes before v in the ordering

*Minimum spanning trees (MST).* Connects all weighted vertices with minimum total weight.
Apps
- Wire an electronic circuit with least amount of wire

Algos: MST-Generic, Kruskal, Prim, MST-Reduce
