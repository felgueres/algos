# Given an M Ã— N matrix of characters, find the length of the longest path in the matrix starting from a given character. 
# All characters in the longest path should be increasing and consecutive to each other in alphabetical order.
# We are allowed to search the string in all eight possible directions, i.e., North, West, South, East, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West.
